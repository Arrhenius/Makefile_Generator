# Makefile_Generator

The Makefile Generator will in due time automatically generate a Makefile for a project when pointed to 
a root project directory. The project is more of a personal attempt to make something extremely useful for
myself and maybe for others, though I suspect there are auto Makefile generators out there already. This 
will be just something more difficult I'd like to tackle on my own.
